# AI Image Denoiser
<p>Welcome to the AI Image Denoiser project, an innovative deep learning solution for image noise reduction and automatic image remastering. This project leverages a custom deep neural network (DNN) model, built using the powerful Dlib library for image processing and AI. Our model is capable of removing various types of noise and grain from images and can even be used for automatic video stream remastering, thanks to its integration with the latest FFMPEG-based functionalities in the Dlib library.</p>
